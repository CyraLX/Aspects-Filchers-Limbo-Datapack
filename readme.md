# Aspects: Filcher's Limbo | A Minecraft Datapack Add-On for [Aspects](https://modrinth.com/datapack/corrupted-aspects)

> This addon is a recreation/reimagining of the Filcher addon for Origins made by MrPlague.  
> You can check it out [here](https://mr-plauge.github.io/final/projects/project_filcher.html) along with their other works.

## Requirements

- **Minecraft Version**: 1.21.5+
- **Aspects Version**: 1.2.0

## Optional

- None

## Features
### Dimensions
- **Limbo:** A wasteland of obsidian that is harmful to anyone that sets foot there, even Filchers themselves. However Filchers place down a **Filcher Anchor** when entering Limbo, which protects them from **it** in a small radius... Only way for non-filchers to leave is to find a pool and have a swim.

## In-Game Documentation *(1.21.6+)*

This extends the base mods documentation

Access from the Pause Menu → **Aspects**

Includes:
- List of Aspects and their information
- List of all Custom Enchantments

## Technical Details
- When a Filcher uses their Focus Ability to teleport to Limbo and they do not have an existing Filcher Anchor, they will teleport in a random location in Limbo from -10000 to 10000 and place their Filcher Anchor there.
- Water Ward enchantment prevents you from leaving Limbo when entering a pool.
- "Dying" to Limbo is not advised.

## FAQ

### My Mods button is overlapping the Aspects button in the Pause Menu!

This issue can be the fault of the Mod Menu (Fabric) mod itself, you can fix it by going into the Mod Menu settings and changing **Game Menu** option to anything else, except for **insert**.
