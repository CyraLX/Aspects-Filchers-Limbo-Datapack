# Filcher's Limbo 1.0.3

## Genral Changes
- (1.21.6+) Many improvements to Aspect Dialogs to make the text more clearer
- (1.21.6+) Fixed Awakened Essence Cages in Dialogs not showing the essence color inside them
- (1.21.5) Fixed Aspect Pickers not being granted
- If a Resource Pack is now missing on the client, the datapack makes it more clear with direct messages
- Updated to support snapshots up to 25w42a (25w43a has weird dimension crashes and save corruptions so it's unsupported for now)

## Aspect Changes
### Filcher
- Added a config to change the radius which new Limbo locations are picked for each Filcher if missing a Filcher Anchor
