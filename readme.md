# Aspects: Filcher's Limbo | A Minecraft Datapack Add-On for [Aspects](https://modrinth.com/datapack/corrupted-aspects)

> This addon is a recreation/reimagining of the Filcher addon for Origins made by MrPlague.  
> You can check it out [here](https://mr-plauge.github.io/final/projects/project_filcher.html) along with their other works.

## Requirements

- **Minecraft Version**: 1.21.6+
- **Aspects Version**: 1.3.0

## Optional

- None

## Features
### Dimensions
- **Limbo:** A wasteland of obsidian that is harmful to anyone that sets foot there, even Filchers themselves. However Filchers place down a **Filcher Anchor** when entering Limbo, which protects them from **it** in a small radius... Only way for non-filchers to leave is to find a pool and have a swim.

### Aspects

## In-Game Documentation *(1.21.6+)*

This extends the base mods documentation

Access from the Pause Menu → **Aspects Menu**

Includes:
- List of Aspects and their information
- List of all Custom Enchantments

## Technical Details
- When a Filcher uses their Focus Ability to teleport to Limbo and they do not have an existing Filcher Anchor, they will teleport in a random location in Limbo from -10000 to 10000 and place their Filcher Anchor there.
- Water Ward enchantment prevents you from leaving Limbo when entering a pool.
- "Dying" to Limbo is not advised.

## FAQ

> *Why is there a missing Resource Pack?*

Likely due to the downloaded Datapack version. You **need** to download the bundled Resource Pack from the same download location where you got the Datapack.

The download for it can be found always on the version page directly, not on the main page of this modification.

Below is an example what the Datapack (top) and Resource Pack (bottom) downloads look like on Modrinth:

> *My Mods button is overlapping the Aspects button in the Pause Menu!*

This issue can be the fault of the Mod Menu (Fabric) mod itself. Make sure that in the Mod Menu settings the **Game Menu** option is **NOT** set to **insert**, if it is, set it to anything else.

> *What are these weird flashes with sounds randomly in Limbo?*

That is the Time Cycle of the dimension. What it means is up for interpretation and is very much intentional.

> *Can I base together in Limbo with another Filcher?*

Yes! If the two or more of you manage to get into one place, you can *extend* the range of your safe location by properly spacing out your Filcher Anchors, *combining* them into a larger area of your choosing.

> *Will this addon get more Aspects?*

Likely not as this is supposed to be a standalone modification for my reimagining of Filcher.
